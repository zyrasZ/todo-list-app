# Todo List App

A simple, colorful Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with data stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence. The interface features a vibrant gradient design and smooth animations using Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Add new tasks by typing and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add" button.
- Mark tasks as completed using checkboxes.
- Delete tasks with a trash icon.
- Responsive design with animated transitions.
- Tasks persist across page reloads using localStorage.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling with Tailwind CSS and custom animations.
- **JavaScript/React**: Dynamic functionality and component-based UI.
- **localStorage**: Stores tasks in the browser.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
